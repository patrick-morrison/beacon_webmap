# Beacon Island Web Map
Example web map of archaeology on Beacon Island, for the WA Museum. Written using Leaflet for R.
This displays geojsons of the burials with custom popups, and a diagram of a burial over a landgate basemap. Images are read in using custom javascript for image overlays, which keeps the file size small.
